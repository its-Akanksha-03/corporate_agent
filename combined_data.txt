When and how to file annual accounts with ADGM






Generally, every ADGM Company and Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) must file annual accounts with the ADGM Registration Authority. Annual accounts are prepared after the end of a financial year and show how the company or LLP has performed over that financial year.





















                Note
                    






Whilst branches and Foundations must maintain accounting records, they are not required to file them annually with the Registrar.






























 Frequently Asked Questions
     








 


What type of accounts do you need to file?




 
What type of accounts you need to file will depend on the type and size of the company or LLP, and the activities conducted. Usually copies of the following must be filed:




Audited annual accounts audited by an ADGM Recognised Auditor (to find a Recognised Auditor, click
 
here
);


Auditors Report;


Director’s Report; and


Board resolution approving the accounts.




Small companies


However, if your firm qualifies as a “small” company or LLP under the small companies regime, it may file a simplified version of accounts instead that includes a copy of the following:




Unaudited balance sheet.




To be eligible as a “small” company or LLP, your firm’s turnover must not be more than USD 13.5 million and your firm must not have not more than 35 employees. Public interest entities and firms providing financial services are not eligible to file simplified accounts under the small companies regime.


If your firm qualifies for and files an unaudited balance sheet under the small companies regime, the unaudited balance sheet must contain a statement that it has been delivered in accordance with the provisions applicable to companies subject to the small companies regime.


Formal requirements


There are other formal legal requirements that must be followed when preparing annual accounts. Some of these include the following:




Annual accounts must be denominated in U.S. Dollars (USD);


All balance sheets must be signed on behalf of the board by a director and the name of that director must also be stated on the balance sheet;


For audited accounts only, the directors report must be signed by a director or the company secretary and the name of that person must be stated; and


For audited accounts only, the auditor’s report must state the name of the audit firm and state the name of the person who signed it as senior auditor.




If the incorrect type of accounts has been filed, or they do not comply with legal requirements, the Registration Authority may return the accounts to you for revision.


Restricted Scope Companies


A Restricted Scope Company will not be required to file annual accounts unless the Registrar has given notice to it to deliver its annual accounts.








 


When do you need to file your annual accounts?




 
Every ADGM company or LLP will have an Accounting Reference Date or ARD. For example, 31 December 2020. This will be the date from which your deadline for filing your accounts will be calculated.


The ARD is set at the time of incorporation and registration and can be viewed on the ADGM online registry system.


Generally, filing deadlines for annual accounts will be as follows:






First annual accounts
 
- For new private companies or LLPs filing their first annual accounts, the deadline for filing its annual accounts will depend if they have a short or long first financial year.


If the financial year is 12 months or less, then the first set of annual accounts
 
must be filed within nine (9) months of its ARD.


If the financial year is more than 12 months, then the first set of annual accounts
 
must be filed within nine months of its first anniversary of incorporation;
 
and






Subsequent annual accounts
 
- For existing private companies or LLPs filing their second or subsequent annual accounts, the annual accounts
 
must be filed within nine (9) months of its ARD.






For example, a company incorporated on 11 November 2019 with an ARD of 31 December 2020 will have a first financial year greater than 12 months. That is, it has a long first financial year (being the period from incorporation, 11 November 2019, through to 31 December 2020).


Therefore, its annual accounts must be filed within nine (9) months of its first anniversary of incorporation. In this case, by 11 August 2021 (i.e. nine months from 11 Nov 2020).


Using the above example further, in the following year the company’s ARD will be 31 December 2021. Its deadline to file its next annual accounts will then be nine (9) months from the ARD, namely 30 September 2022.


Please note that the descriptions above refer to private companies or LLPs. For public companies, the period for filing is six (6) months, rather than nine.


Changing an ARD


Subject to satisfying eligibility requirements, a company or LLP may notify the Registration Authority of a change in ARD via the ADGM online registry solution. A directors’ resolution for the approval or change in ARD must be submitted in support of the change. Directors’ resolution templates can be found
 
here
 
under Resolution Templates.


Account filing extension applications


The Registrar may, for any special reason he thinks fit, approve an application to extend a deadline for filing accounts. Applications requesting approval for extending the period of filing must be submitted prior to the filing due date. Guidance on Application for Annual Accounts Filing Extensions can be found here: 
ADGM Guidance, Templates and Policy Statements
 under Guidance for registered entities..








 


How can you file your annual accounts?




 
All annual accounts must be filed via the ADGM online registry solution.


Access your firm’s account on the ADGM online registry solution, then select “Maintain Company” button from the top menu bar, and then from the drop down menu click on “Lodge Annual Accounts”. Follow the instructions and upload a copy of the annual accounts and any other supporting documents.


After you have submitted your annual return, you will be emailed an automatic acknowledgment.


Your annual accounts may be subject of review by the Registration Authority before being accepted. If so, the annual accounts may be returned to you for revision.


Once your annual accounts filing has been accepted, you will be notified immediately via the online registry solution.

1. INTRODUCTION TO THIS GUIDANCE
Introduction to Abu Dhabi Global Market
Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) is a broad based international financial centre, established pursuant
to Abu Dhabi Law No. 4 of 2013 in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. With its own civil and commercial laws
based on the English common law, ADGM offers the local, regional and international business
community a world-class legal system and regulatory regime.
About this guidance
This guidance is prepared to support Controllers and Processors in complying with the applicable
provisions in the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 (DPR 2021) regarding the processing of
specific categories of sensitive data, also referred to as ‘special categories of data.’ The DPR 2021
requires ADGM Licensed Persons to establish a separate policy document known as an ‘Appropriate
Policy Document’ (“APD”) in cases where a Controller processes certain special categories of
personal data.
Who the guidance is aimed at
This guidance applies to ADGM Licensed Persons who collects and processes special category of
personal data and has day-to-day responsibility for personal data. It is aimed at small and medium
enterprises although it may also be useful for larger organisations and their legal advisors.
Further details are available in relation to the ADGM DPR 2021 requirements in Part 1 of this
Guidance.
What the guidance does
This guidance aims to explain what the APD is and how it may apply to your processing activities.
This guidance includes a template to help you ask the right questions, and understand your obligation.
However, the ultimate responsibility of how to do and how to justify decisions remains with the firm.
This is a key principle of the DPR 2021, known as the accountability principle.
What are special categories of personal data?
Certain types of personal data, known as special categories or personal data, receive additional
protection under the DPR 2021 because they are more sensitive. The DPR 2021 defines the following
as special categories of personal data:
 personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin;
 personal data revealing political opinions;
 personal data revealing religious or philosophical beliefs;
 genetic data;
 biometric data (where used for identification purposes);
 data concerning health;
 data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation;
 personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures.

VER1.0-05082021
---PAGE_BREAK---
Appropriate Policy Document
NOTE: You can only process special categories of personal data if one of the conditions
set out in Article 7(2) of the DPR 2021 applies. For more information about the lawful
basis for processing see Part 1 of the DPR 2021 Guidance.
2. THE REQUIREMENT
What does the law say?
Article 7(3) of the DPR 2021 states that:
Where it is specified that a condition in section 7(2) is met only if the Controller has an
appropriate policy document in place, the Controller will have an appropriate policy
document in place if: (a) the policy document (which may incorporate other documents by
reference) explains, for Personal Data Processed in reliance on the condition:
(i) how the Controller will comply with the principles in section 4; and
(ii) the Controller’s policies regarding the retention and erasure of that Personal Data; and
(b) from the date the Controller starts to Process Personal Data in reliance on the
condition until 6 months after the Controller ceases to carry out such Processing,
the policy document referred to in section 7(3)(a) is:
(i) retained, reviewed and updated (as appropriate); and
(ii) made available to the Commissioner of Data Protection on request.
What specified conditions require an APD?
Section 7(2) of the DPR 2021 sets out the conditions that require Controllers to have an APD in
place.
An APD is required where the processing of special category is:
 Necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the
Controller or of the Data Subject in the field of employment law.
 Necessary for reasons of substantial public interest in:
 (i) the exercise of a function or requirement conferred on a person by Applicable Law;
 (ii) the exercise of a function of the Board, Abu Dhabi or United Arab Emirate government;
 (iii) the administration of justice;
 (iv) equality of opportunity or treatment provided that the Processing does not, or is not
likely to, cause substantial damage or substantial distress to an individual; and it does not
relate to an individual who has given written notice to the Controller not to Process their
Page 3 of 10
VER1.0-05082021
---PAGE_BREAK---
Appropriate Policy Document
Personal Data;
 (v) diversity at senior levels of organisations, where the Controller cannot reasonably be

What about the other conditions?
An APD is not required in all instances where there is processing of special category of personal
data. Where the condition does not specify a need for an APD, you do not need one. You may still
choose to develop one for your own governance and record-keeping.
How does this differ from the mandatory Record of Processing Activity (RoPA)?
The ADP complements the mandatory register of processing activity. The record of processing
encompasses and captures all processing activities within your organisation. The RoPA activity would
be useful in identifying those special category data covered by the above requirement for an APD.
The APD is a standalone policy that is required for demonstrating accountability. The APD must be
made available to data subjects and the Office of Data Protection.

Supplementary Guidance on Whistleblowing




 
In line with global movements favouring transparency, accountability and integrity, ADGM believes a culture that supports speaking up with confidence forms part of any progressive business environment. With that in mind, ADGM has implemented its regulatory framework for whistleblowing (the “Framework”). The Framework includes the WB Regulations; amendments to ER 2019, GEN, MIR and GPM; and this Guidance. This Guidance is issued jointly by the RA under section 3(3) of the WB Regulations and the FSRA under section 15(2) of FSMR. In November 2022, ADGM published its Guiding Principles on Whistleblowing. Those Principles have been incorporated into this Guidance to the extent appropriate, and accordingly the Principles themselves no longer represent current guidance.

In line with global movements favouring transparency, accountability and integrity, ADGM believes a culture that supports speaking up with confidence forms part of any progressive business environment. With that in mind, ADGM has implemented its regulatory framework for whistleblowing (the “Framework”). The Framework includes the WB Regulations; amendments to ER 2019, GEN, MIR and GPM; and this Guidance. This Guidance is issued jointly by the RA under section 3(3) of the WB Regulations and the FSRA under section 15(2) of FSMR. In November 2022, ADGM published its Guiding Principles on Whistleblowing. Those Principles have been incorporated into this Guidance to the extent appropriate, and accordingly the Principles themselves no longer represent current guidance.

* 
Use this template if the company is being incorporated by a body corporate. If the company has more than one shareholder (that is body corporate), each will have to pass the resolution and provide a register of directors or similar evidence of signing authority (that should not be older than three months). This template must be adjusted to indicate that the body corporate will be one of the shareholders/intends to acquire shares.
** 
Use this template if the company is being incorporated by one or more individuals. If the company has more than one shareholder ( that is an individual), amend this template to include all individuals in one resolution.











                Note
                    






If the company is being incorporated by an individual and body corporate, each will have to pass a separate resolution.

permitted activities,
 or alternatively you can talk to our business development team.










 
For Financial Activities
 : Please view the authorisation process overview 
located 
here
. This stage will need to be completed in advance of the Registration and Incorporation.


SPVs and Foundation Applications
 : You will need to firstly confirm if you will be exempt from appointing a Company Service Provider (CSP) to complete your application. To support you with identifying this, we have published a tool to provide indication as to whether you will need to appoint a CSP to submit the application on your behalf.











                Note

tool
 to confirm if you will be exempt from appointing a Company Service Provider (CSP).












 


2. Select the legal structure




 


ADGM permits a wide range of business structures to use. Overview of permitted structures is located 
here










 


3. Check that your proposed name is available for use




 
ADGM has a set of specific rules around the words that can be used within a proposed company name.




If the name 
is similar to an existing name in ADGM
, you will be required to provide evidence that you have the right to use this name.


If your name 
contains sensitive terms
, you will also need to provide evidence that the use of these terms have been approved for use by the relevant authorities. Our portal will provide a warning if you have entered a sensitive term as part of your proposed name (e.g. Bank, Emirates, Abu Dhabi etc.)
